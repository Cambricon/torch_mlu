/**
 * Note [BlockInfoContainer]
 * BlockInfoContainer is used to store the block info of tensors, which is used
 * in for kernel launch and compute. Each kernel can use block info to load,
 * compute and store data.
 *
 * 1) address_array is a two-dimensional array, inner array is to store tensors'
 * ptr, which memory space need be contiguous, and there have same dtype,
 * layout, size and stride. outter array is to tensor lists of inner array; 2)
 * block_size is computed from nram/wram size for each input; 3)
 * repeat_block_num is an accumulated array, where each current repeat num is
 * the sum of the previous repeat num and the current tensor repeat num. And
 *    current repeat num is equal block_size divided by the tensor size;
 * 4) remainder_num is a array, and to store remain num of each input;
 * 5) total_tensor_num is to store the size of inner array tensors.
 *
 * How to get tensor size for each ptr stored in address_array?
 * Ans: repeat_block_num is an accumulated array, so each tensor repeat num is
 * equal to current repeat num sub previous repeat num, and then through this
 * formula to get tensor size. repeat_num * block_size + remainder part.
